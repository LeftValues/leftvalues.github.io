<h2>What is LeftValues?</h2>
    <p>LeftValues is a leftist quiz inspired by and based upon the 8values quiz that seeks to identify your position on the left-wing spectrum. If you are not a leftist, this quiz is obviously not suited for you. You will be presented with a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. There are currently eight questions for each grouping that are all presented in order, rather than scattered. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the values?</h2>
    <p>There are currently six axes, each of which has two opposing values. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#890000;">Revolution</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#FC5959;">Reform</b><br/>
        Those with a higher revolution score tend to support a radical and rapid overthrow of the capitalist system through a mass uprising. Those with a higher reform score tend to favor inducing gradual changes within capitalist structures, such as liberal democracy, with the eventual goal of reaching socialism.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#88232B;">Scientific</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#7F0037;">Utopian</b><br/>
        Those with a higher scientific score tend to support or sympathize with the Marxist analysis of society along the lines of dialectical materialism. Those with a higher utopian score tend to believe in a more idealistic analysis of society and reject materialist approaches.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#560000;">Central</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#000000;">Decentral</b><br/>
        Those with a higher central score tend to support an economic structure based around centralized national planning. Those with a higher decentral score tend to support an economic structure based around decentralized planning, usually on a more localized scale.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#782F52;">International</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#7F3300;">National</b><br/>
        Those with a higher international score tend to support forming an international socialist movement, often with the eventual goal of abolishing nations. Those with a higher national score tend to prioritize building socialism within existing borders and reject the goal of a world socialist republic.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#963B33;">Party</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#7F333B;">Union</b><br/>
        Those with a higher party score tend to support using political parties as the basis of a socialist movement. Those with a higher union score tend to support using trade unions and other forms of mass organization as a basis of a socialist movement.</p>
	<p class="value-description"><b style="color:#804E00;">Industry</b> <b>vs.</b> <b style="color:#586808;">Ecology</b><br/>
        Those with a higher industry score tend to prioritize industrial development and self-sustainability over ecological goals. Those with a higher ecological score tend to support an environmentally oriented economy with strict ecological protections.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>Similar to 8values, this quiz will attempt to match you with a specific leftist ideology. There are currently only eight possible ideologies, with more to come in the future. This is a work in progress and suggestions are very welcome.</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
